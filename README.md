# Vector Approximate Message Passing (VAMP)

Iterative algorithm for solving linear inverse problems based on proximal operations

https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03082 (Rangan, Schniter, Fletcher)

Currently supports solving linear inverse problems of the form
```math
minimize_x    \tfrac12 ||y-Ax||^2 +  Lambda * R(x)
```
For the following functions ```R(x)```
1. LASSO: ```||x||_1```
2. Ridge regression: ```0.5 * ||x||^2```
3. Lp regression: ```||x||_p^p / p``` for p > 1
4. Elastic Net: ```l1_ratio * ||x||_1 + (1 - l1_ratio) * 0.5 * ||x||^2```
